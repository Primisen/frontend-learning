1. Difference between Functions and Methods
Methods declared inside a class and is not an object 

2. What is array in JavaScript?
    2.1 In JavaScript, arrays have a unfixed length, unlike, for example, Java arrays
    2.2 JavaScript types of loops: 
        for
        while
        do-while
        for-in {
            Statement loops through the properties of an Object:
            
            for(key in object) {
                //code
            }

            //example
            const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};
            let text = "";
            for (let x in person) {
                text += person[x];
            } 
        }
        for-of {
            It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more:
            
            const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];
            let text = "";
            for (let x of cars) {
                text += x;
            }
        }

    3. Arrays methods:
        push() -- add element to end of array and return its length
        splice() 

3. How to run JavaScript code? 
    Run from the command line: 
        node file-name.js

    Run from the browser: 
        Create js file
        Create html file and write code in here: 
            <html>
                <head>
                    <script defer src='./file-name.js'></script>
                </head>
            </html>

4. JavaScript pass by reference or value?  
    Primitive values are passed by value.
    Objects (including functions) are passed by reference.
